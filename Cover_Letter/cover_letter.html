      <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
      <p>
        I am Viktor, a professional individual with a strong academic background and practical experience in computer engineering. Currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering at Lviv Polytechnic, I hold a master's degree in Applied Physics from Taras Shevchenko University (Kyiv), where I graduated with honors. My commitment to excellence is evident in my academic achievements, including the presentation of my diploma work at the APHYS 2022 conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my academic accomplishments, I have gained significant hands-on experience with Arduino, FPGA, Raspberry Pi, in practical applications at the Institute of Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. One notable achievement was my role in repairing a scanning electron microscope, where I successfully addressed complex signal-related issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am confident that my foundational knowledge in programming and gaming will contribute positively to your company. I have expertise in process modeling, Arduino and STM32 environments using C++, FPGA, game development, networking, and a growing interest in RISC-V development, which together form a diverse and adaptable skill set.
      </p>
      <p>
        My true motivation stems from a passion for programming and physics. I believe these fields hold immense potential for growth and impactful contributions. I am driven by the opportunity to use my skills to empower others and help them achieve their goals. My master's diploma work, which focused on the effects of channeling in crystals, was recognized at the APHYS 2022 conference, with the main results published in the conference proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Candidate Master of Sport in swimming, I understand the dedication required to achieve ambitious goals. This journey demands mental fortitude, unwavering determination, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Every challenge reinforces the importance of perseverance and the joy of overcoming obstacles.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experiences as a Gaming Mathematician and Freelance C++ Developer have allowed me to apply my programming skills creatively, contributing to high-quality game development and innovative solutions. Additionally, my dedication to education shines through my roles as a Math Tutor and University Assistant, where I have had the privilege of mentoring students in various programming languages and projects. In my current position as an Assistant Teacher, I continue to expand my knowledge in C/C++/Python development while empowering students to reach their goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly excited about the opportunity to apply my expertise in software development, especially in areas like RISC-V architecture and parallel computation, which I have explored during my tenure as a University Assistant. My commitment to research and proficiency in delivering projects within strict timelines make me an ideal candidate for your company.
      </p>
      <p>
        With strong interpersonal, written, and verbal communication skills, I am well-equipped to tackle challenges independently and proactively. My determination to find solutions, even when faced with unfamiliar problems, ensures I can effectively manage any task.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, I would like to emphasize my two core values: honesty and responsibility. These qualities not only benefit the organizations I work with but also foster growth and development among my colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am genuinely enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to your company and eager to continue advancing my skills. Thank you for considering my application. I am available at your convenience to schedule an interview and discuss how I can contribute to your team.
